- can’t click on plots after building is destroyed
- when putting out fires it is easy to accidentally upgrade the building
	tap => tap => tap => build menu opens => upgrade accidentally
	SOLUTION: smoke animation after fire is put out
- house costs mean nothing, art is a lie, nothing is real
- sometimes eating fails to remove the person

- people are still getting highlighted when houses are on fire
- apartments can eat when there are no people to eat
- tapping houses to put out fires or build doesn’t always work
	- could be that the tapable colliders get covered removed somehow
- build menus still open for fully upgraded buildings
